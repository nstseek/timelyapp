# Timely App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.29.

You can see a live preview using [this link](https://timelyapp-nstseek.web.app).

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

Unfortunately I didn't have time to truly test the application, the test coverage reported by Jest isn't that good. I hope I have time in the future to improve unit testing in this project, I usually don't leave testing like this, but since it is only a test project, won't be really used and I don't have time to spend, it will remain like this for some time.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Running linter

Run `npm run lint` to verify project linting using [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/).

## Running prettier

Run `npm run prettier` to verify code formatting using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
